## Example Usage

### Create an Artist Profile
```javascript
const { ArtistProfile } = require('./src/index.js');

const artist = new ArtistProfile('My Artist Name');
artist.registerISRC('US-ABC-21-00001');
artist.registerIPI('00123456789');
artist.registerISWC('T-345.246.317-1');
artist.addStreamingProfile('Spotify', 'spotify:artist:1A2B3C4D5E6F');
artist.displaySummary();
```

### Create a Song Split Sheet
```javascript
const { SongSplitSheet } = require('./src/songSplitSheet.js');

const split = new SongSplitSheet('Song Title', 'Various Artists');
split.addWriter('Writer 1', 'Composer', 50, '00123456789', 'ASCAP');
split.addWriter('Writer 2', 'Lyricist', 50, '00987654321', 'BMI');
split.displaySplitSheet();
split.calculateRoyalties(10000); // Calculate $10,000 split
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create artist profiles for your music
2. ✅ Register your ISRC, IPI, and ISWC codes
3. ✅ Create split sheets for collaborative projects
4. ✅ Link your streaming platform profiles
5. ✅ Calculate and track royalty distributions
6. ✅ Export and backup your metadata
7. ✅ Monitor your royalty registration

## Why Metadata Matters

Independent artists often lose significant royalties because:
- ❌ Metadata isn't properly registered
- ❌ Split sheets aren't documented
- ❌ PRO affiliations aren't linked
- ❌ Streaming platforms can't match payments to correct artists

**This app ensures:**
- ✅ Every piece of music is properly identified
- ✅ All writers are credited and compensated
- ✅ Royalties flow to the right people
- ✅ Complete audit trail for legal protection
